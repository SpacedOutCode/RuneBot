A oneliner that finds the correct answer in a runestone test paste it in and it will log a object with an id like "obj_sde1_optb"; That's the correct answer. To find the component ID, type `window.componentMap[` into the devTools Console an you should see an id with a name that relates to the topic/s of your test. Copy that id and paste it into the `[COMPONENT_ID]` part of the below code.

`window.componentMap['[COMPONENT_ID]'].renderedQuestionArray[parseInt(document.querySelector("li.active a").textContent)-1].question.answerList.find((q) => q.correct)`
